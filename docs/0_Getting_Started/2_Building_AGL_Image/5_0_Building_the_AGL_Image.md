# Building the AGL Image

Building the AGL image involves running BitBake with a specified target.
Depending on whether you are building the image for the first time or if this
is a subsequent build, the time needed for the build could be significant.

It is critical that you specify the correct options and configurations for the
build before executing the `bitbake` command.
The previous sections in the "Image Development Workflow" have treated this setup
in a generic fashion.
This section, provides links to topics with instructions needed to create images for
three types of supported platforms and for emulation using Quick EMUlator (QEMU)
or VirtualBox:

* [x86 (Emulation and Hardware)](./5_1_x86_Emulation_and_Hardware.md)
* [Raspberry Pi 3 or 4](./5_2_Raspberry_Pi_4.md)
* [R Car Gen 3](./5_3_RCar_Gen_3.md)
